         <tr>
           <td><p style = "font-size:20px;"> Chemicals used in Cloud Seeding include silver iodide, dry ice, potassium iodide, liquid propane, and other hygroscopic materials. Once dropped into the clouds by an airplane or shot into the air using a cannon, these chemicals form more ice crystal particles in the clouds. The process of condensation condenses the additional ice particles and creates the type of precipitation depending on the temperature of the atmosphere. As the condensation nuclei expand, precipitation falls earlier. </p>

         </tr><br><br><br>
         <tr>
           <td><p style = "font-size:20px;"> Cloud seeding, although a technique studied since the 1940s, is still controversial in many countries such as the United States due to environmental hazards. This is due to the uncertainty of silver iodide's effects on the environment. The chemical is toxic to marine life; therefore, alternatives are being tested for an eco-friendly solution. On the other hand, countries including China and Russia are supporters of Cloud Seeding weather modifications. </p>
